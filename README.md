Per scholas skill based assessment for front-end skills. 

Video game review website. I will be using this and polishing it for my case study.

three html pages that navigate between each other. Three style sheets for each html page.

One javascript file that is used on the reviews.html page

This website uses dummy data, but i plan to use RAWG api to populate with data

This project uses fa fa font awesome for icons, bootstrap for styling and google fonts.
